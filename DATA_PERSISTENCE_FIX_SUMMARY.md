# Data Persistence Fix - Critical Issue Resolved

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem**: Flights disappear after logout/login because they're saved to the wrong user ID.

**Root Cause**: Development code in production that falls back to a test user when no user is authenticated.

## 🔍 **Technical Analysis**

### What Was Happening:

1. **Upload Process**: User uploads February roster
2. **Authentication Check**: System checks `user?.id` 
3. **Fallback Logic**: If not authenticated → Uses `TEST_USER_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`
4. **Database Save**: Flights saved with `user_id = TEST_USER_ID`
5. **Logout/Login**: User logs in with real user ID (different from TEST_USER_ID)
6. **Dashboard Load**: Queries flights with real user ID → Finds nothing
7. **Result**: Flights "disappear" because they're associated with wrong user

### Code Location:
**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Lines**: 256-267 (before fix)

**Before Fix**:
```typescript
// For development: authenticate as test user if no user is logged in
let effectiveUserId = user?.id;
if (!user?.id) {
  console.log('No user authenticated, signing in as test user...');
  const authResult = await signInAsTestUser();
  if (!authResult.success) {
    salaryCalculator.csvUploadError(`Authentication failed: ${authResult.error}`);
    return;
  }
  effectiveUserId = TEST_USER_ID; // ❌ WRONG: Uses test user ID
  console.log('Successfully authenticated as test user');
}
```

**After Fix**:
```typescript
// Ensure user is authenticated before upload
if (!user?.id) {
  salaryCalculator.csvUploadError('You must be logged in to upload roster files. Please sign in and try again.');
  return;
}

const effectiveUserId = user.id; // ✅ CORRECT: Uses actual user ID
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Test User Fallback** (lines 256-262):
   - Eliminated automatic sign-in as test user
   - Added proper authentication requirement
   - Clear error message for unauthenticated users

2. **Removed Test Auth Import** (line 44):
   - Cleaned up unused import: `signInAsTestUser, TEST_USER_ID`
   - Simplified dependencies

3. **Enforced Authentication**:
   - Upload now requires proper user authentication
   - No more data saved to wrong user ID
   - Consistent user association across sessions

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### Before Fix (Broken):
1. Upload February roster → Saved to TEST_USER_ID ❌
2. Logout/login → Different user ID ❌
3. Dashboard load → No flights found ❌
4. Data appears "lost" ❌

### After Fix (Working):
1. Upload February roster → Saved to actual user ID ✅
2. Logout/login → Same user ID ✅
3. Dashboard load → Flights found ✅
4. Data persists correctly ✅

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### Test Scenario:
1. **Login** as a real user (not test user)
2. **Upload** February roster file
3. **Verify** flights appear in dashboard
4. **Logout** completely
5. **Login** again with same credentials
6. **Check** dashboard → Flights should still be there

### Expected Outcome:
- Flights persist across login sessions ✅
- Data is associated with correct user ID ✅
- No more "disappearing flights" issue ✅

## 🔧 **Technical Validation**

### Database Queries:
```sql
-- Check flights are saved with correct user_id
SELECT user_id, date, flight_numbers, month, year 
FROM flights 
WHERE user_id = '[actual-user-id]' 
AND month = 2 AND year = 2025;

-- Should NOT find flights with test user ID
SELECT user_id, date, flight_numbers, month, year 
FROM flights 
WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
```

### Authentication Flow:
1. User must be properly authenticated ✅
2. Upload uses `user.id` from session ✅
3. Database saves with correct `user_id` ✅
4. Dashboard queries with same `user_id` ✅

## 🚀 **Status**

**Fix Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING**

This was the **root cause** of the data persistence issue. The display problems we worked on earlier were secondary symptoms of this authentication bug.

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - This fix resolves the core data loss issue that was affecting user experience.

---

**Next Steps**: Test the complete upload workflow to confirm flights persist across login sessions.
