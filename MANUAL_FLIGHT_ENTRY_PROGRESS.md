- `src/components/salary-calculator/ManualFlightEntry.tsx` - Main component
- `src/components/salary-calculator/FlightEntryForm.tsx` - Form component with reorganized layout + Recurrent support
- `src/lib/salary-calculator/manual-entry-processor.ts` - Core processing logic + Recurrent calculation
- `src/lib/salary-calculator/manual-entry-validation.ts` - Validation logic with inbound date support + Recurrent validation
- `src/components/salary-calculator/SalaryBreakdown.tsx` - Display component
- `src/types/salary-calculator.ts` - Type definitions + Recurrent duty type
- `src/components/salary-calculator/FlightTypeSelector.tsx` - Duty type selector + Recurrent option
- `src/components/salary-calculator/FlightDutyCard.tsx` - Card display + Recurrent UI

### **Calculation Logic**

```typescript
// Flight Pay Calculation
if (dutyType === 'asby') {
  flightPay = 4 hours √ó hourlyRate  // Fixed 4 hours for ASBY
} else if (dutyType === 'recurrent') {
  flightPay = 4 hours √ó hourlyRate  // Fixed 4 hours for Recurrent
} else if (dutyType === 'turnaround' || 'layover') {
  flightPay = dutyHours √ó hourlyRate  // Actual duty hours
}

// Hourly Rates
CCM: AED 50/hour
SCCM: AED 62/hour

// Fixed Payments
ASBY: CCM 200 AED, SCCM 248 AED
Recurrent: CCM 200 AED, SCCM 248 AED
```

## üöß **Current Issues & Progress (Updated 2025-01-02)**

### **‚úÖ WORKING:**

- Form validation for layover duties (inbound date validation fixed)
- Basic manual flight entry for turnarounds
- Form UI with layover-specific fields (inboundDate, reportTimeInbound, debriefTimeOutbound)
- Validation functions properly include layover fields

### **‚ùå CURRENT ISSUE:**

**Layover Processing Not Working** - Layovers still create only ONE flight duty card instead of TWO separate cards

### **üîç Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Validation is working** - `validateManualEntryRealTime` function properly includes layover fields
2. **Form submission flows correctly** - FlightEntryForm ‚Üí ManualFlightEntry ‚Üí processManualEntry
3. **Issue is in processing chain** - The `convertToFlightDuty` function should return array of 2 duties for layovers but seems to only return 1

### **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details:**

- **File:** `src/lib/salary-calculator/manual-entry-processor.ts`
- **Function:** `convertToFlightDuty` (lines ~59-167)
- **Expected:** Return array with 2 FlightDuty objects for layovers
- **Actual:** Returns array with 1 FlightDuty object (same as turnaround)
- **Layover Logic:** Added at lines 121-147 but may not be executing properly

### **üîß Next Steps for New Agent:**

1. **Debug the `convertToFlightDuty` function** - Add console.log to see if layover condition is being met
2. **Check layover data flow** - Verify that `data.inboundDate`, `data.reportTimeInbound`, `data.debriefTimeOutbound` are properly passed
3. **Test layover condition** - Ensure `data.dutyType === 'layover'` and all required fields are present
4. **Verify function return** - Confirm the function actually returns 2 duties for layovers

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**

- **Follow augment-guidelines:** Update existing functions instead of creating new ones
- **Test incrementally:** Fix one issue at a time, test each change individually
- **Validation is stable:** Don't modify `validateManualEntryRealTime` function - it's working correctly
- **Form data structure:** Layover form includes all required fields (inboundDate, reportTimeInbound, debriefTimeOutbound, isCrossDayOutbound, isCrossDayInbound)

## üéØ **Next Steps / Future Enhancements**

### **Priority: Fix Layover Processing**

- [ ] **Flight Templates** - Save common flight patterns for quick entry
- [ ] **Auto-complete Sectors** - Suggest common airport codes during input
- [ ] **Duty Time Validation** - Warn about excessive duty hours for regulatory compliance
- [ ] **Bulk Import** - Import multiple duties from CSV/Excel files
- [ ] **Flight Number Auto-increment** - Automatically suggest next flight number for consecutive flights

### **Immediate Testing Needed**

- [ ] **Test flight pay calculation** - Verify correct amounts for different positions
- [ ] **Test with different duty types** - ASBY, Turnaround, Layover
- [ ] **Test cross-day flights** - Verify overnight duty calculations
- [ ] **Test form validation** - Edge cases and error scenarios

### **Potential Improvements**

- [ ] **Flight templates** - Save common flight patterns
- [ ] **Auto-complete sectors** - Suggest common airport codes
- [ ] **Duty time validation** - Warn about excessive duty hours
- [ ] **Integration with roster upload** - Seamless workflow

### **Dashboard Integration**

- [ ] **Real-time updates** - Refresh dashboard after adding flights
- [ ] **Monthly view updates** - Update overview cards immediately
- [ ] **Flight duties table** - Show new flights without page refresh

## üêõ **Known Issues / Limitations**

### **Current Limitations**

- ~~Monthly calculation only includes the single added flight (not all flights for the month)~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~No integration with existing roster data for comprehensive monthly totals~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~Success state doesn't automatically refresh the main dashboard~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ~~Single duty entry only (batch entry feature pending)~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED - Batch entry fully implemented**

### **Minor Enhancements**

- Could add flight number validation against Flydubai patterns
- Could add sector validation against IATA airport codes
- Could add duty hour warnings for regulatory compliance
- Could add flight number auto-increment for consecutive flights

## üé® **Current Form Layouts**

### **Layover Duties**

```
[Duty Type Selection: Turnaround | Layover | Airport Standby | Recurrent]

üõ©Ô∏è OUTBOUND SECTOR (brand purple #4C49ED)
Date: [date field]
Flight Number: [single field]
Sector: [DXB] [KHI]
Reporting: [time field]
Debriefing: [time field] + cross-day indicator

üõ©Ô∏è INBOUND SECTOR (brand purple #4C49ED)
Date: [date field]
Flight Number: [single field]
Sector: [KHI] [DXB]
Reporting: [time field]
Debriefing: [time field] + cross-day indicator

[Add Another Duty button]
[Save Batch Only button] (when batch has duties)
[Save Flight Duty button]
```

### **Recurrent Duties (Simplified Layout)**

```
[Duty Type Selection: Turnaround | Layover | Airport Standby | Recurrent]

üìñ RECURRENT TRAINING (brand purple #4C49ED)
Date: [date field]
Reporting: [time field]
Debriefing: [time field] + cross-day indicator

[Add Another Duty button]
[Save Batch Only button] (when batch has duties)
[Save Flight Duty button]
```

**Note**: Recurrent duties use simplified form layout (same as ASBY) with no flight numbers or sectors required.

### **Cross-Day Detection Logic**

- **Outbound cross-day**: Uses outbound date for next-day calculation
- **Inbound cross-day**: Uses inbound date for next-day calculation
- **Independent validation**: Each sector validates cross-day based on its respective date

## üö® **Known Issues & Next Steps (July 8, 2025)**

### **‚úÖ Recently Fixed Issues:**

- [x] **Layover rest period display** - Fixed logic to correctly identify inbound vs outbound flights ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- [x] **Sector parsing logic** - Corrected to check last sector instead of splitting on hyphens ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- [x] **Debug console spam** - Cleaned up excessive logging for better development experience ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### **Minor Issues to Address:**

- [ ] **Flight duty card formatting** - Fine-tuning needed for proper display of layover duties

### **Technical Debt:**

- Console warning about per diem rate in `calculation-engine.ts:222` (may be resolved with recent fixes)

### **Success Confirmation:**

- ‚úÖ **Layover duty creation working** - Successfully creates 2 separate FlightDuty objects
