# Flight Cards Redesign Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to replace the current production flight duty cards with the new uniform design created on the test page. The new design features consistent heights, improved layout, and enhanced layover handling with connected cards interface.

## Current State Analysis

### Production Flight Cards Location

- **Main Component**: `src/components/salary-calculator/FlightDutyCard.tsx`
- **Table Integration**: `src/components/salary-calculator/FlightDutiesTable.tsx`
- **Manager**: `src/components/salary-calculator/FlightDutiesManager.tsx`
- **Dashboard Usage**: `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`

### Current Data Structure

```typescript
interface FlightDuty {
  id?: string;
  userId?: string;
  date: Date;
  flightNumbers: string[];
  sectors: string[];
  dutyType: "turnaround" | "layover" | "asby" | "recurrent" | "sby" | "off";
  reportTime: TimeValue;
  debriefTime: TimeValue;
  dutyHours: number;
  flightPay: number;
  isCrossDay: boolean;
  dataSource: "csv" | "manual" | "edited";
  month: number;
  year: number;
}
```

### Current Data Flow

```
Roster Upload (CSV/Excel) → Parser → FlightDuty Objects → FlightDutyCard
Manual Entry → FlightEntryForm → FlightDuty Objects → FlightDutyCard
Database → FlightDuty Objects → FlightDutyCard
```

## New Design Requirements

### Design Specifications

- **Uniform Height**: 120px for all cards
- **Top Line Layout**: Flight number (left) + Payment badge (center) + Duty badge (right)
- **Center Section**: Airplane icon + Duty type ("Layover" or "Turnaround")
- **Connected Cards**: Layover duties show as connected outbound/inbound with navigation dots
- **Layover Details**: "ZAG 23h 30m - AED 235.00" on outbound segment only

### Key Features

- Consistent visual appearance across all duty types
- Enhanced layover representation with two-segment navigation
- Improved information hierarchy

## ✅ Phase 3.5: Layover Deletion Fix and UI Simplification (COMPLETED)

### ✅ Step 3.5.1: Layover Deletion Issue Resolution

**Problem Identified:**

- Users reported that deleting layover duties would leave orphaned "Layover (No pair found)" cards
- The system was not properly handling layover pair deletion
- Dashboard was using old deletion logic instead of enhanced FlightDutiesManager

**Files Updated:**

- ✅ `src/components/salary-calculator/FlightDutiesManager.tsx`
