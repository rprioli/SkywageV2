# Skywage V2

Skywage is a salary calculator tailored for airline cabin crew and pilots. It processes flight rosters to break down salaries by fixed and variable components, giving clear insights into monthly earnings.

## Project Overview

- **Audience**: CCMs, SCCMs, and pilots
- **Platform**: Desktop-first, mobile later
- **Supported Airline**: Flydubai (expandable)

## ðŸš¨ Recent Critical Fix (January 29, 2025)

**FIXED: User position selection now properly applied to salary calculations**

- **Problem**: Dashboard was using stale auth metadata instead of database profile
- **Impact**: CCM users were getting SCCM rates and vice versa
- **Solution**: Database profile is now the source of truth with automatic recalculation
- **Result**: Position changes immediately trigger recalculation of ALL existing data

**Key Improvements:**

- âœ… CCM users get correct rates: AED 50/hour, 3,275 basic salary
- âœ… SCCM users get correct rates: AED 62/hour, 4,275 basic salary
- âœ… Position changes automatically recalculate all flight duties
- âœ… Real-time synchronization across all components

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Next.js, Shadcn
- **Backend**: Django (Python), JWT auth
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Auth**: Supabase
