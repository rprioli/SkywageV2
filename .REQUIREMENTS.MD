### Flight Data Handling

- CSV Upload: Fixes formatting issues, only reads relevant columns

### CSV Format

- The application should expect a CSV file with roster data in the following format:
  - Contains a section header 'Schedule Details' or column headers with 'Date', 'Duties', 'Details'
  - Date format should be 'DD/MM/YYYY'
  - Flight duties are identified by 'FZ' in the duties column
  - Airport standby duties are identified by 'ASBY' in the duties column
  - Only the Date, Duties, Details, Report Time, Departure, and Debriefing need to be shown/considered
  - If the duty is OFF or X, ignore

### Dashboard

- Month Duties (Date, Duties, Details, Report Time, Departure, Debriefing, Duty Hours, Pay)
- Upload Roster and manual entry buttons (manual support for turnarounds, layovers and standby)
- Ability to upload multiple months' rosters and visualize the duties
- Ability to re-upload a roster csv file for any month, replacing the existent data with the new one
- Edit/Delete entries

### Salary Calculation
