# Upload Display Fix Validation

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: After uploading roster files, flights are not displayed in Flight Duties component on the dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The `refreshDashboardData()` function in `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` was hardcoded to always fetch current month data instead of the uploaded month data.

**Impact**: Users can upload CSV files successfully, but the dashboard doesn't show the uploaded flights because it's looking at the wrong month.

## Fix Applied

### Technical Changes

**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Function**: `refreshDashboardData()` (lines 182-212)

**Before Fix**:

```typescript
const refreshDashboardData = async (
  effectiveUserId: string,
  uploadMonth: number
) => {
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const currentMonth = currentDate.getMonth() + 1;
  const currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();

  // Always refresh current month data for dashboard display
  const flightDutiesResult = await getFlightDutiesByMonth(
    effectiveUserId,
    currentMonth, // ‚ùå WRONG: Always uses current month
    currentYear
  );
  // ... rest of function
};
```

**After Fix**:

```typescript
const refreshDashboardData = async (
  effectiveUserId: string,
  uploadMonth: number
) => {
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();

  // Refresh flight duties for the uploaded month (not current month)
  const flightDutiesResult = await getFlightDutiesByMonth(
    effectiveUserId,
    uploadMonth, // ‚úÖ CORRECT: Uses uploaded month
    currentYear
  );
  // ... rest of function
};
```

## Test Scenario

### Test Data

- **CSV File**: `April_ScheduleReport.csv` (April 2025 data)
- **Current Month**: June 2025
- **Expected Flights**: ~15 flight duties from April 2025
- **Test User ID**: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

### Expected Behavior

**Before Fix (Failure)**:

1. Upload April CSV file successfully ‚úÖ
2. Dashboard refreshes current month (June) data ‚ùå
3. Dashboard shows empty state (no June flights) ‚ùå
4. User cannot see uploaded April flights ‚ùå

**After Fix (Success)**:

1. Upload April CSV file successfully ‚úÖ
2. Dashboard refreshes uploaded month (April) data ‚úÖ
3. Dashboard shows April flights ‚úÖ
4. User can see all uploaded flights immediately ‚úÖ

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Main Dashboard Test

1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
2. Click "Upload Roster" button
3. Select "April" from month dropdown
4. File browser opens automatically - select: `April_ScheduleReport.csv`
5. Wait for upload to complete
6. **Verify**: April flights appear in Flight Duties section

### Option 2: Test Page Test

1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3001/salary-calculator-phase6-test`
2. Scroll to "Phase 7: Real CSV Upload Testing" section
3. Click "Choose File" and select: `April_ScheduleReport.csv`
4. Wait for upload to complete
5. **Verify**: Flights appear in the results

## Validation Checklist

### ‚úÖ Expected Results After Fix:

- [ ] Flight Duties section shows ~15 flights from April 2025
- [ ] Monthly calculation shows April salary breakdown
- [ ] No empty state message
- [ ] Toast notification confirms successful upload
- [ ] Dashboard displays uploaded month data, not current month data

### üîß Technical Validation:

- [ ] `refreshDashboardData()` function uses `uploadMonth` parameter
- [ ] Database queries fetch April 2025 data (month=4, year=2025)
- [ ] Flight duties display with correct April dates
- [ ] Monthly calculations reflect April data

## Development Server Status

- **Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3001`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing
- **Compilation**: ‚úÖ No errors
- **Fix Applied**: ‚úÖ Code changes implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Follow testing instructions above
2. **Validation**: Confirm flights appear after upload
3. **Documentation**: Update if any issues found
4. **Phase 7 Continuation**: Proceed with remaining testing tasks

## Fix Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed refreshDashboardData() function** (lines 186-218):

   - Now fetches data for uploaded month instead of current month
   - Updates overview card to display uploaded month

2. **Lifted selectedOverviewMonth state** (lines 58-83):

   - Moved month selection state from MonthlyOverviewCard to parent component
   - Added proper initialization logic based on available data
   - Enables refreshDashboardData to update the displayed month

3. **Updated MonthlyOverviewCard component** (lines 536-537):
   - Removed local state management
   - Now uses lifted state from parent component

### Technical Flow:

1. User selects "April" for upload ‚Üí `selectedUploadMonth = 4`
2. CSV gets processed and saved to database with `month=4, year=2025`
3. `refreshDashboardData(userId, 4)` is called
4. Function fetches April data from database
5. Function updates `setSelectedOverviewMonth(3)` (0-based index for April)
6. Dashboard displays April flights and April overview data

---

**Fix Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING**

The upload display bug has been fixed. The dashboard will now:

1. Fetch data for the uploaded month (not current month)
2. Switch the overview card to display the uploaded month
3. Show uploaded flights immediately after processing
